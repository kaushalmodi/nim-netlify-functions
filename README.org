Hi there! This is a playground repo to test out
[[https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions][Netlify's Lambda Functions]].
You can see a live demo of the examples at
https://functions-playground.netlify.com.
* Nim source code
The Nim source code is in the [[./src/lambda][*src/lambda*]] directory.
* Generate JS code
To generate the JS code, ~cd~ to that directory and do ~nim genJS~.

The JS code will be generated in ~src/lambda/nimcache~.
